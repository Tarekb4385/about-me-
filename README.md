# about-me
<h1>TAREK BACHIR</h1>
<h2>Student</h2>
<h3>tarekb4385@hstat.org</h3>
<p>I am a student that grew up in america working on becoming something. I wanted to become a doctor for my dream job but I have many other options. History is a major, math is also one, like computers too.</p>
<h4>Schedule</h4>
<p2>I don't have a scheldule actually. I do different things every day so it's hard to stick to a specific schedule every day. But I have a chance of a specific schedule in the summer to be completely honest. I was thinking of exploretory like exploring for items in the underground so if it's expensive i just pawn it off for money and if it's a relic, I just keep it. relics are hard to find and expensive but knowing I have a relic is better than selling it.</p2>
