<p>I am a student that grew up in america working on becoming something. I wanted to become a doctor for my dream job but I have many other options. History is a major, math is also one, like computers too.</p>
**Schedule**
<p2>I don't have a scheldule actually. I do different things every day so it's hard to stick to a specific schedule every day. But I have a chance of a specific schedule in the summer to be completely honest. I was thinking of exploretory like exploring for items in the underground so if it's expensive i just pawn it off for money and if it's a relic, I just keep it. relics are hard to find and expensive but knowing I have a relic is better than selling it.</p2>

**maybe if I had a schedule, it would look like this**: 
1. 8:00 wake up and prepare by eating/brushing teeth/ prepare for school.
2. 9:00 start school 
3. 12:00 done with school and work since i do both all at once.
4. 12:30 games/youtube for a lot of time. I have nothing better to do after school. 
5. 7:00pm I eat dinner. sometimes I skip lunch and I always skip breakfast. 
6. 9:00pm at night is when I uasually go to sleep and then the day restarts itself. 
    foods I eat:  potatos,  fruit  random food i dont know to mention.
    1. food
    2.   drinks like water 
    3.     desserts like chocolate and macaroons.
